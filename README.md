## Customer Churn Analysis
### Why Customer Churn?
Customer churn occurs when customers discontinue their subscription or stop using a service. In the highly competitive telecom industry, churn rates range from 15-25%. Retaining customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn prediction and prevention crucial.

Why It Matters:
Understanding churn patterns enables telecom companies to focus retention efforts on high-risk customers, improving customer loyalty and profitability. Early detection of potential churn requires analyzing customer interactions across channels such as service usage, support calls, and purchase history.

Objectives:
This project explores telecom customer data to answer key questions, including:

What percentage of customers churn versus remain active?
Are there patterns in churn based on demographics like gender?
Which service types are most associated with churn?
What features or services drive profitability?
By addressing these questions, the goal is to help businesses reduce churn and implement effective customer retention strategies.
